# main script from python with setuptools
This is a new example for with the usage of a package installed from pip using normally `setuptools.py`.

### Hint: printing of variable
The function is returning a string directly -> should be usable within rust as well.

## Issue
setuptools isn't supported: https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/pull/2364

is requiring ctypes base the issue?
