# Example from rustpython: hello_embed
This is the example from rustpython with simple python code embedded in rust.
See original file [hello_embed.rs](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/blob/main/examples/hello_embed.rs).


## Issues
After having rustpython added as dependency from git it works out of the box.
