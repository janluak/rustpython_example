# main script from python
This is a new example for with the usage of a package installed from pip.

### Hint: direct usage of module
Since the code is not within a function, rust can invoke the module directly instead of using defined functions.

## Issue
The compiled vm seems not to be aware of the required package though installation of the package is clearly visible during the build process (preparation step defined in `Dockerfile_build`).
